# Do Not Pass This Way Again

Considering MySQL? Use something else. Already on MySQL? Migrate. For every
successful project built on MySQL, you could uncover a history of time wasted
mitigating MySQL's inadequacies, masked by a hard-won, but meaningless, sense
of accomplishment over the effort spent making MySQL behave.

Thesis: databases fill roles ranging from pure storage to complex and
interesting data processing; MySQL is differently bad at both tasks. Real apps
all fall somewhere between these poles, and suffer variably from both sets of
MySQL flaws.

* MySQL is bad at [storage](#storage).
* MySQL is bad at [data processing](#data-processing).
* MySQL is bad [by design](#by-design).
* [Bad arguments](#bad-arguments) for using MySQL.

Much of this is inspired by the principles behind [PHP: A Fractal of Bad
Design](http://me.veekun.com/blog/2012/04/09/php-a-fractal-of-bad-design/). I
suggest reading that article too -- it's got a lot of good thought in it even
if you already know to stay well away from PHP. (If that article offends you,
well, this page probably will too.)

## Storage

Storage systems have four properties:

1. Take and store data they receive from applications.
2. Keep that data safe against loss or accidental change.
3. Provide stored data to applications on demand.
4. Give administrators effective management tools.

In a truly "pure" storage application, data-comprehension features
(constraints and relationships, nontrivial functions and aggregates) would go
totally unused. There is a time and a place for this: the return of "NoSQL"
storage systems attests to that.

Pure storage systems tend to be closely coupled to their "main" application:
consider most web/server app databases. "Secondary" clients tend to be
read-only (reporting applications, monitoring) or to be utilities in service
of the main application (migration tools, documentation tools). If you believe
constraints, validity checks, and other comprehension features can be
implemented in "the application", you are probably thinking of databases close
to this pole.

### Storing Data

MySQL has many edge cases which reduce the predictability of its behaviour
when storing information. Most of these edge cases are documented, but violate
the principle of least surprise (not to mention the expectations of users
familiar with other SQL implementations).

* Implicit conversions (particularly to and from string types) can modify
  MySQL's behaviour.
    * Many implicit conversions are also silent (no warning, no diagnostic),
      by design, making it more likely developers are entirely unaware of
      them until one does something surprising.
* Conversions that violate basic constraints (range, length) of the output
  type often coerce data rather than failing.
    * Sometimes this raises a warning; does your app check for those?
    * This behaviour is unlike many typed systems (but closely like PHP and
      remotely like Perl).
* Conversion behaviour depends on a per-connection configuration value
  (`sql_mode`) that has [a large constellation of possible
  states](http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/server-sql-mode.html), making
  it harder to carry expectations from manual testing over to code or from
  tool to tool.
* MySQL recommends UTF-8 as a character-set, but still defaults to Latin-1.  The implimentation
of `utf8` up until MySQL 5.5 was only the 3-byte [BMP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_Multilingual_Plane#Basic_Multilingual_Plane).  MySQL 5.5 and beyond supports a 4-byte `utf8`, but confusingly must be set with the character-set `utf8mb4`.  Implementation details of
  these encodings within MySQL, such as the `utf8` 
  3-byte limit, tend to leak out into client applications. Data that does not
  fit MySQL's understanding of the storage encoding will be transformed until
  it does, by truncation or replacement, by default.
    * Collation support is per-encoding, with one of the stranger default
      configurations: by default, the collation orders characters according to
      Swedish alphabetization rules, case-insensitively.
    * Since it's the default, lots of folks who don't know the manual
      inside-out and backwards observe MySQL's case-insensitive collation
      behaviour (`'a' = 'A'`) and conclude that "MySQL is case-insensitive",
      complicating any effort to use a case-sensitive locale.
    * Both the encoding and the collation can vary, independently, by
      _column_. Do you keep your schema definition open when you write
      queries to watch out for this sort of shit?
* The `TIMESTAMP` type tries to do something smart by storing values in a
  canonical timezone (UTC), but it's done with so few affordances that it's
  very hard to even _tell_ that MySQL's done a right thing with your data.
    * And even after that, the result of `foo < '2012-04-01 09:00:00'` still
      depends on what time of year it is when you evaluate the query, unless
      you're very careful with your connection timezone.
    * `TIMESTAMP` is also special-cased in MySQL's schema definition handling,
      making it easy to accidentally create (or to accidentally fail to
      create) an auto-updating field when you didn't (did) want one.
    * `DATETIME` does not get the same timezone handling `TIMESTAMP` does.
      What? And you can't provide your own without resorting to hacks like
      extra columns.
    * Oh, did you want to _use_ MySQL's timezone support? Too bad, none of
      that data's loaded by default. You have to process the OS's `tzinfo`
      files into SQL with a separate tool and import that. If you ever want to
      update MySQL's timezone settings later, you need to take the server down
      just to make sure the changes apply.

### Preserving Data

... against unexpected changes: like most disk-backed storage systems, MySQL
is as reliable as the disks and filesystems its data lives on. MySQL provides 
no additional functionality in terms of mirroring or hardware failure tolerance
(such as [Oracle ASM](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_Storage_Management)).
However this is a limitation shared with many, _many_ other systems.

When using the InnoDB storage engine (default since MySQL 5.5), MySQL maintains page
checksums in order to detect corruption caused by underlying storage.  However,
many third-party software applications, as sell as users upgrading
from earlier versions of MySQL may be using MyISAM, which will frequently corrupt
data files on improper shutdown.

The implicit conversion rules that bite when storing data also bite when
asking MySQL to modify data - my favourite example being a fat-fingered
`UPDATE` query where a mistyped `=` (as `-`, off by a single key) caused 90%
of the rows in the table to be affected, instead of one row, because of
implicit string-to-integer conversions.

... against loss: hoo boy. Backup is part of MySQL's enterprise feature differentiation.  As a non-paying community user,your [choices are](http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/backup-methods.html):

* Take "blind" filesystem backups with `tar` or `rsync`. Unless you
  meticulously lock tables or make the database read-only for the duration,
  this produces a backup that requires crash recovery before it will be
  usable, and can produce an inconsistent database.
* Dump to SQL with `mysqldump`: slow, relatively large backups, and
  non-incremental.
* Archive binary logs: fragile, complex, over-configurable, and configured
  badly by default. (Binary logging is also the basis of MySQL's replication
  system.)

The other options are to purchase an 
[Enterprise Subscription](http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/glossary.html#glos_mysql_enterprise_backup) from Oracle,
or install a third party tool such as [Percona's Xtrabackup](http://www.percona.com/doc/percona-xtrabackup/).

Like many of MySQL's features, the binary logging feature is
[too](http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/binary-log.html)
[configurable](http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/replication-options-binary-log.html),
while still, somehow, defaulting to modes that are hazardous or surprising:
the
[default](http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/replication-options-binary-log.html#sysvar_binlog_format)
[behaviour](http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/replication-formats.html)
is to log SQL statements, rather than logging their side effects. This has
lead to numerous bugs over the years; MySQL (now) makes an effort to make
common "non-deterministic" cases such as `NOW()` and `RANDOM()` act
deterministically but these have been addressed using ad-hoc solutions.
Restoring binary-log-based backups can easily lead to data that differs from
the original system, and by the time you've noticed the problem, it's too late
to do anything about it.

(Seriously. The binary log entries for each statement contain the "current"
time on the master and the random seed at the start of the statement, just in
case. If your non-deterministic query uses any other function, you're still
[fucked by
default](http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/replication-sbr-rbr.html#replication-sbr-rbr-sbr-disadvantages).)

Additionally, a number of apparently-harmless features can lead to backups or
replicas wandering out of sync with the original database, in the default
configuration:

* `AUTO_INCREMENT` and `UPDATE` statements.
* `AUTO_INCREMENT` and `INSERT` statements (sometimes). SURPRISE.
* Triggers.
* User-defined (native) functions.
* Stored (procedural SQL) functions.
* `DELETE ... LIMIT` and `UPDATE ... LIMIT` statements, though if you use
  these, you've misunderstood how SQL is supposed to work.
* `INSERT ... ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE` statements.
* Bulk-loading data with `LOAD DATA` statements.
* [Operations on floating-point
  values](http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/replication-features-floatvalues.html).

### Retrieving Data

This mostly works as expected. Most of the ways MySQL will screw you happen
when you store data, not when you retrieve it. However, there are a few things
that implicitly transform stored data before returning it:

* MySQL's surreal type conversion system works the same way during `SELECT`
  that it works during other operations, which can lead to queries matching
  unexpected rows:

        owen@scratch> CREATE TABLE account (
            ->     accountid INTEGER
            ->         AUTO_INCREMENT
            ->         PRIMARY KEY,
            ->     discountid INTEGER
            -> );
        Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.54 sec)

        owen@scratch> INSERT INTO account
            ->     (discountid)
            -> VALUES
            ->     (0),
            ->     (1),
            ->     (2);
        Query OK, 3 rows affected (0.03 sec)
        Records: 3  Duplicates: 0  Warnings: 0

        owen@scratch> SELECT *
            -> FROM account
            -> WHERE discountid = 'banana';
        +-----------+------------+
        | accountid | discountid |
        +-----------+------------+
        |         1 |          0 |
        +-----------+------------+
        1 row in set, 1 warning (0.05 sec)

    Ok, unexpected, but there's at least a warning (do your apps check for
    those?) - let's see what it says:

        owen@scratch> SHOW WARNINGS;
        +---------+------+--------------------------------------------+
        | Level   | Code | Message                                    |
        +---------+------+--------------------------------------------+
        | Warning | 1292 | Truncated incorrect DOUBLE value: 'banana' |
        +---------+------+--------------------------------------------+
        1 row in set (0.03 sec)

    I can count on one hand the number of `DOUBLE` columns in this example and
    still have five fingers left over.

    You might think this is an unreasonable example: maybe you should always
    make sure your argument types exactly match the field types, and the query
    should use `57` instead of `'banana'`. (This does actually "fix" the
    problem.) It's unrealistic to expect every single user to run `SHOW CREATE
    TABLE` before every single query, or to memorize the types of every column
    in your schema, though. This example derived from a technically-skilled
    but MySQL-ignorant tester examining MySQL data to verify some behavioural
    changes in an app.

    * Actually, you don't even need a table for this: `SELECT 0 = 'banana'`
      returns `1`. Did the [PHP](http://phpsadness.com/sad/52) folks design
      MySQL's `=` operator?

    * This isn't affected by `sql_mode`, even though so many other things are.

* `TIMESTAMP` columns (and _only_ `TIMESTAMP` columns) can return
  apparently-differing values for the same stored value depending on
  per-connection configuration even during read-only operation. This is done
  silently and the default behaviour can change as a side effect of non-MySQL
  configuration changes in the underlying OS.
* String-typed columns are transformed for encoding on output if the
  connection is not using the same encoding as the underlying storage, using
  the same rules as the transformation on input.
* Values that stricter `sql_mode` settings would reject during storage can
  still be returned during retrieval; it is impossible to predict in advance
  whether such data exists, since clients are free to set `sql_mode` to any
  value at any time.

### Efficiency

For purely store-and-retrieve applications, MySQL's query planner (which
transforms the miniature program contained in each SQL statement into a tree
of disk access and data manipulation steps) is sufficient, but only barely.
Queries that retrieve data from one table, or from one table and a small
number of one-to-maybe-one related tables, produce relatively efficient plans.

MySQL, however, offers a number of tuning options that can have dramatic and
counterintuitive effects, and the documentation provides very little advice
for choosing settings. Tuning relies on the administrator's personal
experience, blog articles of varying quality, and consultants.

* <strike>The MySQL query cache defaults to a non-zero size in some commonly-installed
  configurations. However, the larger the cache, the slower writes proceed:
  invalidating cache entries that include the tables modified by a query means
  considering every entry in the cache. This cache also uses MySQL's LRU
  implementation, which has its own performance problems during eviction that
  get worse with larger cache sizes.</strike>  The query cache is officially disabled-by-default in MySQL 5.6,
  but with 1M allocated to it so that it 'works as soon as it is enabled'.
* Some memory-management settings, such as the MyISAM `key_buffer_size` do not scale very well
  as the size is increased.  MySQL also does not offer parallel query execution.
* <strike>InnoDB, out of the box, comes configured to use one large (and automatically
  growing) tablespace file for all tables, complicating backups and storage
  management. This is fine for trivial databases, but MySQL provides no tools
  (aside from `DROP TABLE` and reloading the data from an SQL dump) for
  transplanting a table to another tablespace, and provides no tools (aside
  from a filesystem-level `rm`, and reloading _all_ InnoDB data from an SQL
  dump) for reclaiming empty space in a tablespace file.</strike> Fixed in MySQL 5.6.
* MySQL itself provides very few tools to manage storage; tasks like storing
  large or infrequently-accessed tables and databases on dedicated filesystems
  must be done on the filesystem, with MySQL shut down.

## Data Processing

Data processing encompasses tasks that require making decisions about data and
tasks that derive new data from existing data. This is a huge range of topics:

* Deciding (and enforcing) application-specific validity rules.
* Summarizing and deriving data.
* Providing and maintaining alternate representations and structures.
* Hosting complex domain logic near the data it operates on.

The further towards data processing tasks applications move, the more their
SQL resembles tiny programs sent to the data. MySQL is totally unprepared for
programs, and expects SQL to retrieve or modify simple rows.

### Validity

Good constraints are like `assert`s: in an ideal world, you can't tell if they
work, because your code never violates them. Here in the real world,
constraint violations happen for all sorts of reasons, ranging from buggy code
to buggy human cognition. A good database gives you more places to describe
your expectations and more tools for detecting and preventing surprises.
MySQL, on the other hand, can't validate your data for you, beyond simple (and
fixed) type constraints:

* As with the data you store in it, MySQL feels free to change your table
  definitions [implicitly and
  silently](http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/silent-column-changes.html).
  Many of these silent schema changes have important performance and
  feature-availability implications.
    * Foreign keys are ignored if you spell them certain, common, ways:

            CREATE TABLE foo (
                -- ...,
                parent INTEGER
                    NOT NULL
                    REFERENCES foo_parent (id)
                -- , ...
            )

        silently ignores the foreign key specification, while

            CREATE TABLE foo (
                -- ...,
                parent INTEGER
                    NOT NULL,
                FOREIGN KEY (parent)
                    REFERENCES foo_parent (id)
                -- , ...
            )

        preserves it.

* Foreign keys, one of the most widely-used database validity checks, are an
  engine-specific feature, restricting their availability in combination with
  other engine-specific features. (For example, a table cannot have both
  foreign key constraints and full-text indexes, as of MySQL 5.5.)
    * Configurations that violate assumptions about foreign keys, such as a
      foreign key pointing into a MyISAM or NDB table, do not cause warnings
      or any other diagnostics. The foreign key is simply discarded. SURPRISE.
      (MySQL is riddled with these sorts of surprises, and apologists lean
      very heavily on the "that's documented" excuse for its bad behaviour.)
* The MySQL parser recognizes `CHECK` clauses, which allow schema developers
  to make complex declarative assertions about tuples in the database, but
  [discards them without
  warning](http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/create-table.html). If you
  want `CHECK`-like constraints, you must implement them as triggers - but see
  below...
* MySQL's comprehension of the `DEFAULT` clause is, uh, limited: only
  constants are permitted, except for the [special
  case](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/timestamp-initialization.html)
  of at most one `TIMESTAMP` column per table and at most one sequence-derived
  column. Who designed this mess?
    * Furthermore, there's no way to say "no default" and raise an error when
      an INSERT forgets to provide a value. The default `DEFAULT` is either
      `NULL` or a zero-like constant (`0`, `''`, and so on). Even for types
      with no meaningful zero-like values (`DATETIME`).
* MySQL has no mechanism for introducing new types, which might otherwise
  provide a route to enforcing validity. Counting the number of special cases
  in MySQL's [existing type
  system](http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/data-types.html) illustrates
  why that's probably unfixable.

I hope every client with write access to your data is absolutely perfect,
because MySQL _cannot help you_ if you make a mistake.

### Summarizing and Deriving Data

SQL databases generally provide features for doing "interesting" things with
sets of tuples, and MySQL is no exception. However, MySQL's limitations mean
that actually processing data in the database is fraught with wasted money,
brains, and time:

* Aggregate (`GROUP BY`) queries run up against limits in MySQL's query
  planner: a query with both `WHERE` and `GROUP BY` clauses can only satisfy
  one constraint or the other with indexes, unless there's an index that
  covers all the relevant fields in both clauses, in the right order. (What
  this order is depends on the complexity of the query and on the distribution
  of the underlying data, but that's hardly MySQL-specific.)
    * If you have all three of `WHERE`, `GROUP BY`, and `ORDER BY` in the same
      query, you're more or less fucked. Good luck designing a single index
      that satisfies all three.
* Even though MySQL allows database administrators to [define normal functions
  in a procedural SQL
  dialect](http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/create-procedure.html),
  [custom aggregate
  functions](http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/create-function-udf.html)
  can only be defined by native plugins. Good thing, too, because procedural
  SQL in MySQL is its own kind of awful - more on that below.
* Subqueries are often convenient and occasionally necessary for expressing
  multi-step transformations on some underlying data. MySQL's query planner
  has only one strategy for optimizing them: evaluate the innermost query as
  written, into an in-memory table, then use a nested loop to satisfy joins or
  `IN` clauses. For large subquery results or interestingly nested subqueries,
  this is absurdly slow.
    * MySQL's query planner can't fold constraints from outer queries into
      subqueries.
    * The generated in-memory table never has any indexes, ever, even when
      appropriate indexes are "obvious" from the surrounding query; you cannot
      even specify them.
    * These limitations also affect views, which are evaluated as if they were
      subqueries. In combination with the lack of constraint folding in the
      planner, this makes filtering or aggregating over large views completely
      impractical.
    * MySQL lacks [common table
      expressions](http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.2/static/queries-with.html).
      Even if subquery efficiency problems get fixed, the inability to give
      meaningful names to subqueries makes them hard to read and comprehend.
    * I hope you like `CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE AS SELECT`, because that's your
      only real alternative.
* [Window
  functions](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Select_(SQL)#Window_function) do not
  exist at all in MySQL. This complicates many kinds of analysis, including
  time series analyses and ranking analyses.
    * Specific cases (for example, assigning rank numbers to rows) can be
      implemented using [server-side variables and side effects during
      `SELECT`](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6473800/assigning-row-rank-numbers).
      What? Good luck understanding that code in six months.
* Even interesting joins run into trouble. MySQL's query planner has trouble
  with a number of cases that can easily arise in well-normalized data:
    * Joining and ordering by rows from multiple tables often forces MySQL to
      dump the whole join to a temporary table, then sort it -- awful,
      especially if you then use `LIMIT BY` to paginate the results.
    * `JOIN` clauses with non-trivial conditions, such as joins by range or
      joins by similarity, generally cause the planner to revert to table
      scans even if the same condition would be indexable outside of a join.
    * Joins with `WHERE` clauses that span both tables, where the rows
      selected by the `WHERE` clause are outliers relative to the table
      statistics, often cause MySQL to access tables in suboptimal order.
* Ok, forget about interesting joins. Even interesting `WHERE` clauses can run
  into trouble: MySQL can't index deterministic functions of a row, either.
  While some deterministic functions can be eliminated from the `WHERE` clause
  using simple algebra, many useful cases (whitespace-insensitive comparison,
  hash-based comparisons, and so on) can't.
    * You can fake these by storing the computed value in the row alongside
      the "real" value. This leaves your schema with some ugly data repetition
      and a chance for the two to fall out of sync, and clients must use the
      "computed" column explicitly.
    * Oh, and they must maintain the "computed" version explicitly.
    * Or you can use triggers. Ha. See above.

And now you know why MySQL advocates are such big fans of doing data
_processing_ in "the client" or "the app".

### Alternate Representations and Derived Tables

Many databases let schema designers and administrators abstract the underlying
"physical" table structure from the presentation given to clients, or to some
specific clients, for any of a number of reasons. MySQL tries to let you do
this, too! And fumbles it quite badly.

* As mentioned above, non-trivial views are basically useless. Queries like
  `SELECT some columns FROM a_view WHERE id = 53` are evaluated in the
  stupidest -- and slowest -- possible way. Good luck hiding unusual
  partitioning arrangements or a permissions check in a view if you want any
  kind of performance.
* The poor interactions between triggers and binary logging's default
  configuration make it impractical to use triggers to maintain "materialized"
  views to avoid the problems with "real" views.
    * It also effectively means triggers can't be used to emulate `CHECK`
      constraints and other consistency features.
    * Code to maintain materialized views is also finicky and hard to get
      "right", especially if the view includes aggregates or interesting joins
      over its source data. I hope you enjoy debugging MySQL's procedural
      SQL…
* For the relatively common case of wanting to abstract partitioned storage
  away for clients, MySQL actually has [a
  tool](http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/partitioning.html) for it! But
  it comes with [enough caveats to strangle a
  horse](http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/partitioning-limitations.html):
    * It's a separate table engine wrapping a "real" storage engine, which
      means it has its own, separate support for engine-specific features:
      transactions, foreign keys, and index types, `AUTO_INCREMENT`, and
      others. The syntax for configuring partitions makes selecting the wrong
      underlying engine entirely too easy, too.
    * Partitioned tables may not be the referrent of foreign keys: you can't
      have both enforced relationships and this kind of storage management.
    * MySQL doesn't actually know how to store partitions on separate disks or
      filesystems. You still need to reach underneath of MySQL do to actual
      storage management.
        * Partitioning an InnoDB table under the default InnoDB configuration
          stores all of the partitions in the global tablespace file anyways.
          Helpful! For per-table configurations, they still all end up
          together in the same file. Partitioning InnoDB tables is a waste of
          time for managing storage.
    * TL,DR: MySQL's partition support is so finicky and limited that
      MySQL-based apps tend to opt for multiple MySQL servers ("sharding")
      instead.

### Hosting Logic In The Database

Yeah, yeah, the usual reaction to stored procedures and in-DB code is "eww,
yuck!" for some not-terrible reasons, but hear me out on two points:

* Under the freestanding-database-server paradigm, there will usually be
  network latency between database clients and the database itself. There are
  two ways to minimize the impact of that: move the data to the code in bulk
  to minimize round-trips, or move the code to the data.
* Some database administration tasks are better implemented using in-database
  code than as freestanding clients: complex data migrations that can't be
  expressed as freestanding SQL queries, for example.

MySQL, as of version
[5.0](http://dev.mysql.com/doc/relnotes/mysql/5.0/en/news-5-0-0.html)
(released in 2003 -- remember that date, I'll come back to it), has support
for in-database code via a procedural SQL-like dialect, like many other SQL
databases. This includes server-side procedures (blocks of stored code that
are invoked outside of any other statements and return statement-like
results), functions (blocks of stored code that compute a result, used in any
expression context such as a `SELECT` list or `WHERE` clause), and triggers
(blocks of stored code that run whenever a row is created, modified, or
deleted).

[languages](http://www.firebirdsql.org/file/documentation/reference_manuals/reference_material/html/langrefupd15-psql.html),
MySQL's procedural dialect contains some very strange and unfortunate design
choices:

* There is no language construct for looping over a query result. This seems
  like a pretty fundamental feature for a database-hosted language, but no.
* There is no language construct for looping while a condition holds. This
  seems like a pretty fundamental feature for an imperative language designed
  any time after about 1975, but no.
* There is no language construct for looping over a range.
* There is, in fact, one language construct for looping: the unconditional
  loop. All other iteration control is done via conditional `LEAVE`
  statements, as

        BEGIN
            DECLARE c CURSOR FOR
                SELECT foo, bar, baz
                FROM some_table
                WHERE some_condition;
            DECLARE done INT DEFAULT 0;
            DECLARE CONTINUE HANDLER FOR NOT FOUND
                SET done = 1;
            
            DECLARE c_foo INTEGER;
            DECLARE c_bar INTEGER;
            DECLARE c_baz INTEGER;
            
            OPEN c;
            process_some_table: LOOP
                FETCH c INTO c_foo, c_bar, c_baz;
                IF done THEN
                    LEAVE process_some_table;
                END IF;
                
                -- do something with c_foo, c_bar, c_baz
            END LOOP;
        END;

    The original "structured programming" revolution in the 1960s seems to
    have passed the MySQL team by.

* Okay, I lied. There are two looping constructs: there's also the `REPEAT ...
  UNTIL condition END REPEAT` construct, analogous to C's `do {} while
  (!condition);` loop. But you still can't loop over query results, and you
  can't run zero iterations of the loop's main body this way.
* There is nothing resembling a modern exception system with automatic scoping
  of handlers or declarative exception management. Error handling is entirely
  via Visual Basic-style "on condition X, do Y" instructions, which remain in
  effect for the rest of the program's execution.
    * In the language shipped with MySQL 5.0, there wasn't a way to signal
      errors, either: programmers had to resort to stunts like [intentionally
      issuing failing
      queries](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/465727/raise-error-within-mysql-function),
      instead. Later versions of the language addressed this with the
      [`SIGNAL`
      statement](http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/signal.html): see,
      they _can_ learn from better languages, eventually.
* You can't escape to some other language, since MySQL doesn't have an
  extension mechanism for server-side languages or a good way to call
  out-of-process services during queries.

The net result is that developing MySQL stored programs is unpleasant,
uncomfortable, and far more error-prone than it could have been.

## Why Is MySQL The Way It Is? { #by-design }

MySQL's technology and history contain the seeds of all of these flaws.

### Pluggable Storage Engines

Very early in MySQL's life, the MySQL dev team realized that MyISAM was not
the only way to store data, and opted to support other storage backends within
MySQL. This is basically an alright idea; while I personally prefer storage
systems that focus their effort on making one backend work very well,
supporting multiple backends and letting third-party developers write their
own is a pretty good approach too.

Unfortunately, MySQL's storage backend interface puts a very low ceiling on
the ways storage backends can make MySQL behave better.

MySQL's data access paths through table engines are very simple: MySQL asks
the engine to open a table, asks the engine to iterate through the table
returning rows, filters the rows itself (outside of the storage engine), then
asks the engine to close the table. Alternately, MySQL asks the engine to open
a table, asks the engine to retrieve rows in range or for a single value over
a specific index, filters the rows itself, and asks the engine to close the
table.

This simplistic interface frees table engines from having to worry about query
optimization - in theory. Unfortunately, engine-specific features have a large
impact on the performance of various query plans, but the channels back to the
query planner provide very little granularity for estimating cost and prevent
the planner from making good use of the engine in unusual cases. Conversely,
the table engine system is totally isolated from the actual query, and can't
make query-dependent performance choices "on its own". There's no third path;
the query planner itself is not pluggable.

Similar consequences apply to type checking, support for new types, or even
something as "obvious" as multiple automatic `TIMESTAMP` columns in the same
table.

Table manipulation -- creation, structural modification, and so on -- runs
into similar problems. MySQL itself parses each `CREATE TABLE` statement, then
hands off a parsed representation to the table engine so that it can manage
storage. The parsed representation is lossy: there are plenty of forms MySQL's
parser recognizes that aren't representable in a `TABLE` structure, preventing
engines from implementing, say, column or tuple `CHECK` constraints without
MySQL's help.

The [sheer number of table
engines](http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/storage-engines.html) makes
that help very slow in coming. Any change to the table engine interface means
perturbing the code to each engine, making progress on new MySQL-level
features that interact with storage such as better query planning or new SQL
constructs necessarily slow to implement and slow to test.

### Poor Priorities

Early on, the MySQL team focused on pure read performance and on "ease of use"
(for new users with simple needs, as far as I can tell) over correctness and
completeness, violating Knuth's laws of optimization. Many of these decisions
locked MySQL into behaviours very early in its life that it still displays
now. Features like implicit type conversions legitimately do help streamline
development in very simple cases; experience with [other
languages](http://me.veekun.com/blog/2012/04/09/php-a-fractal-of-bad-design/)
unfortunately shows that the same behaviours sandbag development and help hide
bugs in more sophisticated scenarios.

While the MySQL (and MariaDB, and Percona) teams have matured greatly, MySQL's
massive and, frequently, not terribly database-heavy userbase makes it very
hard to introduce breaking changes. At the same time, adding _optional_
breaking changes via server and client mode flags (such as `sql_mode`)
increases the cognitive burden involved in understanding MySQL's behaviours --
especially when that behaviour can vary from client to client, or when the
server's configuration is out of your control (on a shared host).

A solution similar to Python's `from __future__ import` pragmas for making
breaking changes opt-in some releases in advance of making them mandatory
might help, but MySQL doesn't have the kind of highly-invested, highly-skilled
user base that would make that effective -- and it still has all of the
problems of modal behaviour.

It wouldn't be so frustrating if I could assign poor faith to someone, but no,
the MySQL folks are here to _help_.

## Bad Arguments

Inevitably, someone's going to come along and tell me how wrong I am and how
MySQL is just fine as a database system. These people are everywhere, and they
mean well too, and they are almost all wrong. There are two good reasons to
use MySQL:

1. **Some earlier group wrote for it, and we haven't finished porting our code
    off of MySQL.**
2. **We've considered all of these points, and many more, and decided that
    `___feature_x___` that MySQL offers is worth the hassle.**

Unfortunately, these aren't the reasons people do give, generally. The
following are much more common:

* **It's good enough.** No it ain't. There are plenty of other equally-capable
  data storage systems that don't come with MySQL's huge raft of edge cases
  and quirks.
    * **We haven't run into these problems.** Actually, a lot of these
      problems happen _silently_. Odds are, unless you write your queries and
      schema statements with the manual open and refer back to it constantly,
      or have been using MySQL since the 3.x era _daily_, at least some of
      these issues have bitten you. The ones that prevent you from using your
      database intelligently are very hard to notice in action.
* **We already know how to use it.** MySQL development and administration
  causes brain damage, folks, the same way PHP does. Where PHP teaches
  programmers that "array" is the only structure you need, MySQL teaches
  people that databases are awkward, slow, hard-to-tune monsters that require
  constant attention. That doesn't have to be true; there are comfortable,
  fast, and easily-tuned systems out there that don't require daily care and
  feeding or the love of a specialist.
* **It's the only thing our host supports.** [Get](http://linode.com/) [a](http://www.heroku.com/) [better](http://gandi.net/) [host](https://www.engineyard.com). It's
  not like they're expensive or hard to find.
    * **We used it because it was there.** Please hire some fucking software
      developers and go back to writing elevator pitches and flirting with Y
      Combinator.
* **Everybody knows MySQL. It's easy to hire MySQL folks.** It's easy to hire
  MCSEs, too, but you should be hiring for attitude and ability to learn, not
  for specific skillsets, if you want to run a successful software project.
    * **It's popular.** Sure, and nobody ever got fired for buying
      IBM/Microsoft/Adobe. Popularity isn't any indication of quality, and if
      we let popularity dictate what technology we use and improve we'll never
      get anywhere. Marketing software to geeks is _easy_ - it's just that
      lots of high-quality projects don't bother.
* **It's lightweight.** So's [SQLite 3](http://www.sqlite.org) or
  [H2](http://www.h2database.com/html/main.html). If you care about deployment
  footprint more than any other factor, MySQL is actually pretty clunky (and
  embedded MySQL has even bigger problems than freestanding MySQL).
* **It's getting better, so we might as well stay on it.** [It's
  true](http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.6/en/mysql-nutshell.html), if you go
  by feature checklists and the manual, MySQL is improving "rapidly". 5.6 is
  due out soon and superficially looks to contain a number of good changes. I
  have two problems with this line of reasoning:
    1. Why wait? Other databases are good _now_, not _eventually_.
    2. MySQL has a history of providing the bare minimum to satisfy a feature
    checkbox without actually making the feature work well, work consistently,
    or work in combination with other features.
